# Hi, I'm Anne Maina 👋

I’m a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for exploring systems, finding vulnerabilities, and building secure digital solutions. I love understanding how things work under the hood and turning that knowledge into practical security skills.  

### My Focus Areas:
- Ethical hacking & penetration testing  
- Network security & vulnerability analysis  
- Security tools and automation  

When I’m not diving into code or testing systems, I like to:
- Keep up with the latest cybersecurity news and trends  
- Work on personal security projects  
- Challenge myself with CTFs (Capture The Flag competitions)  

I created this portfolio to showcase my projects, experiments, and my journey in the cybersecurity field. Feel free to check out my projects and get in touch if you’re interested in collaboration!
